## Phrases that contain debatable annotations
This folder contains all 2,783 PSD and 5,532 PS examples that were **initially annotated** by Upwork linguistics-expert annotators **but rejected** by both MTurk verifiers and Upwork expert verifiers.

We release this folder following the advice from NeurIPS reviewer [Y8XH](https://openreview.net/forum?id=NETsAaKwzMp&noteId=UIej3DPr_Le):

> I agree with your statement that it could be undesirable to use debatable labels in benchmarks. However, I am not convinced that they should be entirely ignored. On the contrary: exactly these cases could be a starting point for future research (e.g., here are difficult cases, find ways to disambiguate it). One easy solution would be to simply make a subset of these cases and make them available to people. Could this be done or are these cases simply gone?
